## 2002-2019 - System Developer and Partner

# The "SiteWorks" Years - Part I

My three colleagues and I founded SiteWorks in 2002 after we had the opportunity to buy out the product we had started developing under Telia Internet. For the next 16 years, I was the main developer behind two custom CMS systems that have been used on more than 1,500 sites over time. Both systems were built on a SQL Server database; the old CMS was built in Classic ASP, and a newer rewrite was written in .Net MVC C#.

The CMS is still in use by major sites like <a href="https://aidsfondet.dk/" target="_blank">Aidsfondet.dk</a>, <a href="https://www.artisten.dk/" target="_blank">Artisten.dk</a>, <a href="https://www.bikestardo.com/" target="_blank">Bikestardo.com</a>, and <a href="https://webshop.fodterapeut.dk/" target="_blank">Danske Fodterapeuter WebShop</a>.

The system is also utilized for event registrations and has been used by Danske Bank, Deloitte, VÃ¦kstfonden; see more examples <a href="http://www.tilmeldingssystem.dk/Cases" target="_blank">here</a>.
