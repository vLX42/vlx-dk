## 2002-2018 - System Developer and Partner
# The "SiteWorks" Years - Part I

Me and three others started SiteWorks in 2002 after we had the opportunity to buy out the product, we started developing under Telia Internet. And for the next 16 years I was the main developer behind two custom CMS system that has been used on more than 1.500 sites over time. Both system where build on a SQL-Server database and the old CMS was built in Classic ASP and a newer rewrite written in .Net MVC C#.

The CMS is still being used by big sites like <a href="https://aidsfondet.dk/" target="_blank">Aidsfondet.dk</a>, <a href="https://www.artisten.dk/" target="_blank">Artisten.dk</a>, <a href="https://www.bikestardo.com/" target="_blank">Bikestardo.com</a>, <a href="https://webshop.fodterapeut.dk/" target="_blank">Danske Fodterapeuter WebShop</a>

The system is also used for event registrations, and have been used by Danske Bank, Deloite, VÃ¦kstfonden, see more examples <a href="http://www.tilmeldingssystem.dk/Cases" target="_blank">here</a>.
