## 2002-2018 - System Developer and Partner
# The "SiteWorks" Years - Part II

Often some of our bigger customers in Siteworks needed a custom solution, <a href="https://www.artisten.dk/" target="_blank">Dansk Artist Forbund</a> needed a solution for their members to create a contract online between an artist and a venue.

This where my first React.js solution and the backend were created in .Net core. The application consisted of a big form depending on the user input you would end up with different choices. There was also a approval process that would end up with binding PDF contract.
