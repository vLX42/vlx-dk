# The "SiteWorks" Years - Part II

Often, some of our larger customers at SiteWorks required custom solutions. For example, <a href="https://www.artisten.dk/" target="_blank">Dansk Artist Forbund</a> needed an online solution for their members to create contracts between artists and venues.

This was my first React.js project, and the backend was built in .Net Core. The application features a comprehensive form; based on user input, different options become available. The process also includes an approval mechanism that culminates in a binding PDF contract.
