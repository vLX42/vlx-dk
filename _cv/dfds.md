## 2019-? Frontend Developer

# DFDS A/S

At DFDS, I'm working on the Freight B2B solution, besides some on-and-off maintenance on the old .Net MVC solution. We're in the process of rewriting the application to use a new microservice backend. We are responsible for developing a new Frontend and a BFF (Backend for Frontend). We're using React.Js/Next.Js for the frontend and Nest.js for our backend.

We're working with a Serverless setup and a DevOps flow in GitHub Actions, with automated tests in Jest and ~~Cypress.io~~ Playwright.
