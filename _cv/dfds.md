## 2018-? Frontend Developer

# DFDS A/S

At DFDS I'm working with the Freight B2B soultion, beside some on and off maintenance on the old .Net MVC solution.
We are in the processs of rewriting the application to use a new microservice backend where we are responsible for writing a new Frontend and a BFF (Backend for Frontend). We are using React.Js/Next.Js for the frontend and Nest.js for our backend.

We are working with a Serverless setup, with a devop flow in GitHub Action with automated test in Jest and Cypress.io.
