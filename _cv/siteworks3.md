One of our other customers Danske Fodterapeuter also had a need for a contract solution, there flow where even more complicated. They had a tenant contract where the clinic owners needed to follow a 50-page guide to construct the contract. So, I constructed a similar solution to them with a bit different flow and some more help functions.

This solution was also written in React.js, Redux and .Net Core. Because this was only accessible for users logged into the main page some user authentication was also added.
