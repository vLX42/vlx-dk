# The "SiteWorks" Years - Part III

Another customer, Danske Fodterapeuter, also required a contract solution, but their workflow was even more complex. They had a tenant contract, and clinic owners needed to follow a 50-page guide to construct it. I developed a similar solution for them, but with a different workflow and additional helper functions.

This solution was also built using React.js, Redux, and .Net Core. Since it was only accessible to users logged into the main page, user authentication features were added.
